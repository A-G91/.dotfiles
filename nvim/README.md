 1) Requires a nerd font for icons to show correctly:

 2) Need to have a terminal that supports 'true color' (24-bit colors)
    (i.e: MacOS Terminal.app does not support it so colors look off)

 3) For rust, get the path of the the rust-analyzer and symlink it to cargo/bin so it is in the path. (this is assuming cargo/bin is in the path already)
